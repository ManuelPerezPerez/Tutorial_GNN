My Solutions to homework problems and programming assignments for Stanford's cs224w Machine Learning with Graphs (2021) course.

I strongly recommend the following playlists to learn PyG for anyone doing the course- 
1. [Antonio Longa's PyTorch Geometric Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGMXrbDNfqTzqxB1IGgimuhtfAhGd8lHF)
2. [Antonio Longa's Advanced PyTorch Geometric Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGMXrbDNfqTwPxitLVHEbT9Pd6-oR_cud)

Pending - Colab 5, rest of the slides.

<u>I am planning to upload typeset LaTeX solutions soon!</u><br>
If you find any discrepancies in the solutions, please feel free to write to me at my email! (set subject to "[cs224w]").
